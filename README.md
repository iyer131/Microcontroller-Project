Project Description
This project is a microcontroller-based game inspired by Dance Dance Revolution. Characters (A, B, C, and D) fall toward a target line on a TFT LCD, and the player must press the corresponding key on the keypad to earn points. 
The score is displayed on an eight-digit seven-segment display, updated in real time. 
A song, played from an SD card, synchronizes with the character animations, and two LEDs provide feedback on player accuracy: a green LED for correct inputs and a red LED for missed inputs.

Objectives
Display falling characters on the TFT LCD.
Play music from an SD card through a DAC, in sync with the animations.
Use hardware timers to synchronize music, visuals, and scoring.
Use green and red LEDs to indicate if the player pressed the correct button on time.
